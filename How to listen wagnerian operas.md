#### How to listen wagnerian operas?







Good day to you all. I've been asking myself for a long time. Are there any enthusiasts here who have listened to his operas in their entirety, from first to last note? I've tried listening many times - I can't. I either fell asleep or turned it off. Is there any way to absorb and understand the beauty of his works? Many of the excerpts from his operas make a stirring impression on me, but I cannot listen to the whole.

I think that, like with any complex music, you have to listen to one piece in parts over and over again (listen to it, so to speak), and not in a timetable, but in the right frame of mind. But for that you have to live music. That's probably why it didn't work out for me either.

But seriously, to me, any opera at 4 o'clock is not worth making at all. Because the psychophysiology of perception is a decidedly refractory thing.
In Wagner's case, there is hardly any special component of the musical writing that causes difficulties of reading.
As my friend Vladimir said: "If you were to remove all the lengths of "Tristan und Isolde" and "Parsifal", that would indeed be power and beauty":)
Personally, I only watch his video productions, even dividing them up into manageable lengths, by the way, without much of a mood.
And to be honest, I'm sure I'm not the only one who gets bored in places.

I'm bored of listening to operas in general.
Except for some Russian ones. Maybe partly because they have Pushkin in them. )

I only listened to operas in their entirety at performances. I always listened to an opera in a recording for half an hour or an hour at the most. And I didn't go on to the next part until the previous one was put off. Lohengrin, Tannhäuser, The Dutchman, Tristan - I listened to it three or five times on purpose. I listened to Mozart 6-8 times for each side of the records. As a result, I can remember Mozart by heart from any place - in big whole chunks. Wagner - only the key passages. And I still haven't gone through all the operas - you can do that if you devote all your leisure time to it. The time spent is rewarded by the fact that you can then listen to the music without any records, CDs or phonograms, with your inner ear alone.

I think listening to Wagner's operas is like reading Ulysses, The Iliad-Odyssey, The Divine Comedy and similar monumental works of human genius. In a certain sense, a reading of these works is, of course, a manifestation of the heroic element in our lives. I personally listened to most of Wagner's operas in the following way: I took what I thought was the best performance, which I had previously spent a long time hunting for, took the complete opera libretto in verse form (which can be sung through), put on headphones and listened to one disc with a book in hand for a couple of days to memorize it better and present it. So each opera (4 discs) took me a week of my life and it was great!



I did about the same, only I listened to 1 disc a day.
Libretto in the original language + quality performance = total immersion in the world of legends!



You see, I love opera. I get a kick out of Italian, French and Russian opera. But it's the Wagner operas that I can't listen to FULLY. If "Parsifal", "Tristan und Isolde" and "Tannhäuser" are bearable, you can still risk listening to them all, but the Tetralogy is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. Even my God Herbert von Karajan doesn't help. And he has opened my love for many things. The Tetralogy, even in its golden form, I can't listen to. The only thing I liked from the tetralogy was Maazel's orchestral compilation. It was it that opened up for me what this tetralogy smells like in the first place.



I started listening to it on cassette, memorising fragments, but now I listen with pleasure to everything from the Dutchman to Parsifal,
Rienzi in places, fairies, the prohibition of love I can't listen to, it was hard to remember act 1 of Tristan at first but then Frau Flagstad and Herr Melchior helped me out and now I listen with pleasure

the ring in general I like to listen to it from anywhere, I'm just a fan. 



All in all, this is not surprising. The Ring, after all, is the fruit of an obsession with the idea of creating a gigantic, multi-day creation by the new means of Wagner's invented "music of the future". When an artist is carried away by manic intentions, they dazzle him, and he thinks least of all about the realities of perception. 

There were a couple of decades of Wagneromania at the end of the 19th century, when a certain section of the intelligentsia aspired to Wagner at the Bayreuth and other theatres as a kind of shrine. But for that too, one had to be fanatically infected by Wagner's music as an artistic religion.   



I wonder if something similar is happening today. Are there any analogues, however faint?

You know, remembered Pianist Grigory Sokolov, somewhat charismatic as the only one who resembles Richter, Gilels and other greats of the past.  He performs in Europe and St. Petersburg, but has avoided Moscow on principle for some reason. I know from social networks that there are groups of people who find out when he has concerts in St. Petersburg and take a special train there for a day from Moscow. Then they create threads on forums dedicated to one particular concert and share their impressions for a long time.

I'm a little jealous of them.
I asked why only football came immediately to mind :)
There are of course fans of various rock bands and so on, but the classics have gone 'cold' ;)

I've listened to the tetralogy from start to finish about 5 times, I think I'm alive and ready for new exploits. 

It's an interesting topic.  I've only listened to every Wagner opera from start to finish once in one sitting, I just decided at some point that I needed to put myself to the test. True, I listened with the clavier in hand and keeping track of the text. I have no desire to repeat such feats and now I only listen to separate excerpts. But I think that such "sessions with Wagner" were not in vain - they were useful.  And in general his libretto is the most uninteresting and boring page in his oeuvre, this endless trashing of horned mythological heroes and ladies with helmets.... but Wagner must have been very serious about it all. But all this muttering, thank God, is flooded with gorgeous music, for the sake of which one can and should listen to his operas.



God be with you. The essence of Wagnerism is in the libretto, and without it Wagner's music cannot be understood (conversely, neither can it).

And if you don't like mythology, there's The Meistersingers. 

It's clear that the whole Wagnerian form and music revolves around the lyrics, but I don't like his lyrics, that's all.
I love mythology and I love The Meistersingers too.  But Wagner's pseudo-mythological scales don't.

I first studied the texts thoroughly...then I listened to them in full (one day - one act), not counting the pieces I particularly liked (I saw them very often). Then - at the theatre (it was generally the best version from the very beginning). The Ring must be listened to in the same chronological order as the events there - first Golden Rhine, then, twenty or thirty years later, Valkyrie, twenty more years later Siegfried, and finally Gotterdammerung, you only have to wait a couple of years (just kidding).
But actually, why force yourself? It's not work))



The question is not exactly on topic, but close to it. Is Wagner specifically the problem? Some Baroque operas go for three hours or more: Vivaldi's Otton in the Villa is about three hours, Titus Manlius about four hours; Handel and other composers' operas go for about the same amount of time. Vivaldi and Handel, IMHO, are the best of the baroque, and those are hard to hear so Hear. How do you manage to listen to baroque operas for 3-4 hours? Besides, in respect of music saturation these operas are weaker than romantic ones, there are many recitatives which are difficult or even impossible to remember, for instance, for me...
Unless one focuses on the melodies, on those particular passages in the operas which are richer in the music...?

If you speak at least a little English, here it is:

there's an excellent interactive CD that allows you to experience The Ring. The performance of The Ring, conducted by G. Scholti's clavier notes are attached there, the words in German with an English translation, and the English commentary on top. the sound is quite decent.

I don't quite understand why so much importance is attached to the length of the operas. After all, even in Bayreuth the Ring is not listened to in one day, but over four evenings. So it is not only possible to listen to each opera separately, but also to listen to the individual parts.

On the literary side, Wagner used Mittelhochdeutsch, i.e. literary German from the period (approximately!!!) between 1050 and 1350. (Note in brackets: the translation "Middle Upper German" is complete nonsense). For modern Germans it is not a very comprehensible language and for a better understanding many, e.g. Nietzsche, were specifically, separately acquainted with the text of the opera. So, to have an idea of what it is all about, it is better to use the available translations, and not to fool yourself. If you want a more complete picture - in the series "Literary Monuments" there are translations of "The Song of the Nibelungs," as well as "The Elder Edda" and "The Younger Edda. The books are small in size.

Wagner not only wrote the text and music of The Ring, but he also developed detailed stage directions. Virtually everything that modern opera directors "invent" differs from his instructions. "He based the Ring on the principle of performances during the Dionysian festivals, where three performances were given after the eve of the feast: on the first day a tragedy, on the second a comedy, and on the third a tragedy again. Siegfried is thus closer to comedy in this cycle.

The leitmotifs in his operas are very important. It is very important to know them in order to understand these operas. They are related not just to the characters but also to the objects (the motif of the ring, for example), and they often sound like indications of hidden correlations. On this disc, by the way, these leitmotifs are shown and can be found in various places in the operas.

There's nothing overly complicated about The Ring, there's a lot of good music, there's a lot of music that will just get on your nerves (but surprisingly, that's good music too), and there are passing episodes designed to give the listener a chance to come to their senses. Don't do it as a heavy duty, like, "I have to, Fedya. If you don't like it, you'd better give it up rather than torturing yourself, because there is a lot of music, and good music, which some people don't like. It's just not their music, there's nothing wrong with that.



It went like this for me. I once heard from my music teacher that Didier Marouani had borrowed the melody of the second movement of his Cosmic Opera from Ghibli des Gods (which was not true, there was nothing like that in Ghibli des Gods). A few years later I saw in the poster that Gergiev was coming to the University with Siegfried and the Ghibliotheus of the Gods. They were performing the first act of Siegfried and the third act of Götterdämmerung. I was horrified by the first act of Siegfried and did not watch the Götterdämmerung. This was my first introduction to Wagner's operas.

I then listened to Gergiev's ugly performance of Boris Godunov at the Vyborg Castle on television and realised that perhaps it was Gergiev, and not Wagner, who was to blame for my dislike of Siegfried. I bought the Bayreuth (Boulez -79) recording on cassette and was convinced that this was the case. Very quickly Boulez's Siegfried became my favourite opera recording. The more canonical recordings like Scholti or Knappertsbusch never really caught my fancy, though. "I've compiled Parsifal myself out of various performances.

Yes, Wagner's libretti are a bit verbose, which translates into length in the music. But with such harmonies and orchestrations one can tolerate them. My favourite Wagner operas are Parsifal, Love's Prohibition, Siegfried and Lohengrin. Also, his librettos are very clever and can be discussed long and earnestly, finding more and more depth there, perhaps verbosity is the inevitable price for such depth.

The more serious problem with Wagner is that he was a man of an evil soul, and in his music you can feel it. Tristan und Isolde in particular is a sin with which many of the musicians have been known to go on sick leave after a performance, the first performer of Tristan went mad, and during a performance of the duet "The Night of Love" two conductors died right on the stage. In this music strong, but very unhealthy feelings are conveyed very precisely. I myself once noticed that as soon as I switched on "Tristan and Isolde" I started booring everybody on the internet, corresponding with this music. This opera is an ingeniously written instrument of destruction. Nevertheless, I'm very sorry that a recording of this opera conducted by my beloved Boulez exists only in very poor quality. Although who knows, maybe if I had heard it in good quality I would have gone mad or killed myself? (Although, perhaps some of the people I sassed while listening to recordings of this opera would be glad I did.)

Yes, not everyone would agree that Wagner's music has a very powerful effect on the psyche. After my first acquaintance with Gergiev's Siegfried, this viewpoint seemed to me to be pure nonsense: how could this dull, inexpressive pile-up have any effect at all, the music is completely unremarkable and boring. But with Boulez and Karajan, Siegfried is not boring at all and is very expressive. In the case of music as complex as Wagner's, the performance decides everything. Many people, on the contrary, love Scholti and dislike Boulez.

Now closer to the subject. What do people love Wagner for anyway? For colourful orchestrations, for pathos and power. All this is achieved by the extended orchestra, the operas Siegfried and Das Rheingold introduced anvils there, and Wagner used this with great skill. For his epic plots, his fusion of epic with psychologism is a precursor of modern fantasy. Dragons, mermaids, knights, beautiful ladies. For the rich harmonies, personally I particularly admire the harmonies of "Parsifal". For the absence of recitative, which carries no musical load, his operas are musically substantial throughout. For monumentality and grandiosity: the great lengths are not always tedious lengths, Wagner has plenty of grandiose structures, which are very beautifully constructed, for example, the choral scenes in the first act of Parsifal, the third act of Siegfried or the aria of the captain of the ghost ship in The Flying Dutchman. For the vivid colour of each opera. Listening to The Flying Dutchman one hears the sound of the wind whistling through the gear of an old ship. Listening to Forbidden Love you forget it was written by a German and become immersed in the atmosphere of medieval Sicily. Listening to Lohengrin you feel like being at a knight's tournament. In Siegfried the sound of the orchestra's individual instruments melt into images of the evil dwarf's cave, the rustling of the linden forest and the night thunderstorm. Wagner immerses us in a fairy tale with meticulously detailed details, what's not to understand?

Yes, some people dislike noisy, intense arrangements, pathos, ideological intensity of music, grandiose form. Some like the way opera music is neatly divided into arioso episodes and recitatives. Some do not like music that is strongly representational, preferring something abstractly melodic. They can't like Wagner, so why force yourself?



If you collect all 42 variants of Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungen, you receive the Ring of Omnipotence. It is made to order and worn on your nose to make all the other philophonists jealous. After that you don't have to listen to Wagner any more, you can just stroke the Ring. That's what my music teacher told me...



I would rephrase the question as follows. How do you learn to listen to Wagnerian recordings by Scholti? As far as I understand, Wagnerians en masse are very fond of this conductor's recordings. But how do they overlook the lack of a coherent performance concept and crooked sound design? Doesn't this clumsy heaviness kill the grandeur of the music? Why is Solti's Das Rheingoldt considered the most colourful, if it is so scattered into separate sounds, each living its own life? As far as I am concerned, the colourful Das Rheingold is Karajan's, but not Solti's. And what he did with Siegfried and Parsifal is impossible to listen to. The only exceptions are The Götterdämmerung and The Flying Dutchman which aren't bad.



Thank you for your views on Wagner's operas. Is it possible to hear Wagner's opera in the beautiful ancient city of Sukhum ?



As a Wagnerian with little, but still my own experience, I believe that Wagner's operas should not only be listened to, but also seen. The '89 production of Zawallisch-Lenhof's The Ring convinced me of this. Audio, on the other hand, in my opinion, is published either to introduce you to Wagner-conductors-orchestras (compilation soliloquies) or for those who are strongly into it (complete recordings of the operas). In short, I urge you not to shy away from the obviousness of this way of getting to know Wagner's operas and look for a production acceptable to your ear and eye.
